# OptiVLSI

### Done for as part of coursework for AE6102 : Parallel Scientific Computing and Visualization


*Very Large Scale Integration abbreviated as VLSI involves digital circuits dealing with billions
of transistors, and requires computerized design automation, design verification and testing
algorithms. Digital circuits are often represented using graphs, where the logic gates are nodes
and their interconnections are the edges. Since VLSI circuits have millions of logic gates,
there is a need for fast and highly optimized graph algorithms.*
