Lee's Algorithm

make virtual environment for python : `python3 -m venv lee`
set up libraries required for lee's algorithm: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

we are making use of automan to compare the performance of the following
(1) numba accelerated lee's algorithm
(2) regular pythonic lee's algorithm
(3) networkx bfs based lee's algorithm

the plot generated by automan can be found in /manuscripts/figures/Lee
to run the automan script run `python3 automate.py`
